Technology &amp; Information System 2024/2025

This course expands my knowledge about computer software and hardware, system analysis and design, database, network, cybersecurity and cloud computing. Besides, this course also allows me to get to know more about the industry related to my programme. It gives me a clear vision about what I can aim to become after finishing this programme. I wish that more industry visits can be done during this course especially for the big company.
